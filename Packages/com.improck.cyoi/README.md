### Notice ###
The Choose Your Own Inspector (CYOI) product and its source code are not to be repackaged or reformed into a _competing product_, sold, or otherwise redistributed for compensation of any kind. My intention is for CYOI to remain a free tool for everyone to use without fees. That said, the source code herein is being made available, and others may find parts of the code to be useful in their own products. The intention and explicit wording of the license leaves room for such usage of CYOI's source code. If you are in doubt about usage, please just send me an email and ask.
